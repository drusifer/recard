> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_SPRINT_1_2.md` (2026-08-15 15:26:20) — Full Recard build across two sprints. Sprint 1 ('v1 playable deck'): P2P same-room card deck app end to end - PRD/architecture/5 implementation phases/close-out testing (3 bugs found+fixed)/retro/launch, verified via a real 2-browser Playwright e2e suite over live WebRTC. A judge loop ('*judge tool and skill usage') then scored the session's tool/skill usage at 98/100 and fixed a skill-doc defect (BUG-001: judge/bob-protocol docs claimed a nonexistent 'make judge-trace' wrapper). Sprint 2 ('clear backlog', v1.1, US-12..18): card orientation (face-up/shared-facedown/private-facedown) generalized via one owner+faceUp redaction rule, reveal/pickup actions, score tracking, quick-start game presets, an in-app rules reference, and a confirmed solo-play guarantee - all 6 phases implemented, UAT'd, and folded into the e2e suite, zero v1 regressions.

---

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_SPRINT_3_4.md` (2026-08-15 22:38:49) — Sprint 3 ('zones, presence, hand tools', v1.2): named zones, deck/opponent-hand visuals, live cursor+lift cue, hand sort with persistent order, incremental Deal More, pass marker - all 9 phases shipped, 1 UX bug found+fixed at close (mini-hand duplicate count). Sprint 4 ('top-down table redesign', v1.3): top-down table with per-viewer seating, personal per-seat zones, drag-and-drop play/move, live real-time card-drag broadcast restoring the PRD's original Principle 6 - all 6 implementation phases shipped, test-driven from Phase 25 onward per user request, seating.js extracted as pure/unit-tested module. A real 5+-player mobile density finding was measured precisely and reported honestly as improved-not-fully-resolved.

---

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_recard-sprint-9.md` (2026-08-20 12:34:17) — Sprint 9 (touch parity, US-40/D28). Cypher found native HTML5 DnD is mouse-only, so six sprints of drag work never existed on the PRD's primary device. Smith's Gate 1 killed the proposed axis-intent gesture using two overflow declarations (neither axis is free) and set press-and-hold; Gate 2 caught that the D13 lift cue fired on raw pointerdown, so the table saw a lift before the holder did. Morpheus's D28 extracted the drop bodies as their own phase so touch and mouse share one implementation. Four phases, three fix loops that each caught something real: Trin found performHandReorder had no coverage at all, Morpheus found a detached-source lift stranding a ghost, and Smith's close-out phone test found the ghost rendering BELOW the finger because the scale property multiplies a transform translate. Groom found the README two sprints stale and US-38/39 never written down. 160 unit + real hasTouch e2e green.

---

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_recard-sprint-10.md` (2026-08-20 15:17:54) — Sprint 10 (US-41 deal-on-the-deck, US-42 auto-start). Triggered by the user asking 'how to re-deal?' - the answer exposed the defect: Reshuffle&Reset doesn't deal, and the only control that did was named for something else in a row about zones. Morpheus's D29 kept pile-level actions as a SEPARATE table from D25's per-card ones, which both prevented an irreversible action appearing in a hover row and dissolved Smith's empty-deck blocker structurally. Smith's Gate 2 argued that making a destructive action discoverable creates new risk, so Reshuffle&deal got a confirm. Three bugs found by running it: a once-only guard that was never true, an uncaught over-deal throw, and auto-start dealing to a still-connecting peer - leaving a ghost seat holding everyone's cards. D30 corrected in the doc rather than quietly in code. 166 unit + e2e green.

---

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_recard-sprint-11.md` (2026-08-20 15:49:56) — Sprint 11 (US-43/44/45): restarting waits for the table. Cypher found the request was hollow as stated - persistence.js stripped hands, so 'restore the game' restored empty hands. D26 had stripped them because guest ids were unstable, a premise D27 removed three sprints earlier; D31 reverses it on the record and D26 is marked superseded in place. Smith's Gate 1 blocker: don't wait for players who had already left, since the snapshot stores everyone ever seated - that became the pure expectedReturners(). Gate 2 caught that D31 falsified Smith's own Sprint 7 prompt wording. Four bugs found by running it: session.ready() never settling so a bounded retry became infinite, an unregistered host-lost event, restore orphaning hands via a stale comment, and the manual Deal path seating unsettled peers - the same defect Sprint 10 fixed only in auto-start. 171 unit + e2e green.

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_SPRINT_12_22.md` (2026-08-25 19:15:00) — Sprint 12 ("piles are the interaction", v2.0) through Sprint 22 (D53, Zone/Pile polymorphism proven by Solitaire+Spit) plus the ad-hoc post-Sprint-22 session that drove Zone and Pile apart into genuine separate Web Components (six components by session end: score-zone/deck-zone/zone-panel/seat-zone/fan-pile/header-actions, later further consolidated - see D54). D53 follow-up (Gin Rummy real discard zone), usesMiddle field retirement, and the panel move/resize-made-local rework are also covered.

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_sprint23_D56.md` (2026-08-26 16:43:19) — Sprint 23 close-out (Phases 68-71: SPLIT_PILE/TAKE_PILE/SET_PILE_ORIENTATION, Zone-as-real-entity D55) followed by D56: Pile/Zone flat modules rewritten as real ES class hierarchies (FoundationPile extends RunPile extends MeldPile), eliminating proven duplication (redactCard/canRemoveCard/cardActions copy-pasted across 4+ files). User rejected phased migration mid-session ('okay to break things, no backward compat, delete stale tests') - D56 landed as one direct pass instead of a sized sprint. Neo investigated rather than building blind: Actionable/Movable/Resizable mixins REJECTED (renderPileShell/wirePanelLayout already shared, no duplication to remove); ScoreZone integration ruled OUT of scope (real feature change to replicated state, not dedup) - both documented as placeholders. Real bug self-caught: HandPile.tableSide mis-set false, fixed, guarded by a mutation-verified test. Trin UAT PASSED (mutation-verified 2 load-bearing points), Morpheus review APPROVED (LOC check: 614->595 lines despite 2 net-new classes). One non-blocking finding: 11 AP-VIA-READ flags (via enabled but not used for exploration this session).

---

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_techdebt_sprint.md` (2026-08-27 12:35:32) — Tech-debt sprint (US-64..68): adopted ESLint (D58), fixed 1021->7 lint findings (D59), cut dead code/CSS, removed a fully-stale e2e suite after escalation (D60), DRY'd touch-drag wiring + fixed a real live bug found along the way. Also 2 mid-sprint nits: fixed Zone title-bar drag unification, refreshed+corrected the Gin Rummy preset.

---

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_save-layout-remove-changetype.md` (2026-08-27 15:26:34) — Sprint: Save Layout/SaveAs, Remove Zone/Pile, changePileType (US-69..73, D61-D63). Full cycle Cypher->Smith Gate1->Morpheus arch->Smith Gate2->Mouse plan->6 phases (79-84) Neo/Trin/Morpheus Bloop->Oracle groom. Key finding: player-created zones/piles use crypto.randomUUID() ids, so saved layouts only cover stable-id built-in panels (D61). Two live UX bugs found+fixed (Table-pile always-fails Remove button; 1px scroll regression). 393/393 tests, lint baseline unchanged.

---

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT-ARCHIVE-20260901.md` (2026-09-01 19:10:00) — Save-layout-remove-changetype groom through the start of D91/D92: Zone/Pile naming fix (D90), fully-permissive drag-and-drop Core invariant established (D82-D85, "no matter what" made fully literal - no per-card ownership check, no viewer restriction, card-identity redaction gone entirely), card-conservation invariant (D88) added as a structural guarantee, card-back rendering made polymorphic + Meld family finished (D91), and the start of "a deck is just a pile of cards" reframing that became D92-D93.

---

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_TECHDEBT2_D114.md` (2026-09-05 00:07:25) — Second tech-debt sprint. D114: decoupled RESHUFFLE_DEAL from RESET (per-card originPileId, new host-only reset action, fixed a real truth-in-labeling bug in the process). US-107: all 8 cognitive-complexity/naming lint findings fixed by extraction (main.js/dropTarget.js/touchDrag.js/ui.js), npm run lint fully clean. US-108: groomed stale e2e.smoke.mjs references (2 real ones fixed, 1 own cross-session memory retired). Phase 108 reserved slot: fixed a real .deck-stack duplicate min-width CSS bug found via the full lint pipeline. All gates passed, no rework, 654 unit + 18 browser green throughout.

---

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_US117_D132.md` (2026-09-11 01:20:51) — Session tail: gear reposition + flake fix, all-players-get-all-pile-actions (D129 arc close), bob-protocol On-Entry additions to every persona SKILL.md. Main arc: Infinity Table (US-117) - table zoom + focus-zoom-on-hover/click. Two mid-flight design revisions before code (D130 camera -> D131 grow-pile-in-place -> D132 manual dial+presets, each a direct user correction), then a clean 3-phase build (111 zoom dial/presets, 113 focus-zoom core, 114 edge-case clamp fix + drag-out proof). Two real bugs found and fixed live: auto-fit conflicting with the 44px touch-target floor (led to D132's manual-control pivot), and a clamp math bug from measuring a pile's flex-constrained size instead of its true unconstrained size once reparented. Trin's UAT independently found and closed a real test-coverage gap (re-render survival was never actually tested) before approving. 11 new source/test files, 802/802 unit + 21 live-browser tests across 3 new suites, lint-js/lint:design baselines held or improved throughout.

---

> **Previous sprint archived:** `agents/chat_archive/CHAT_SPRINT_MULTIPLAYER_HARNESS.md` (2026-09-18 18:44:00) — US-118 multi-player test harness (Tier 2). Morpheus's saved design (drive peers by protocol, DOM queries local, every peer a real headless page) refined at planning into one submitAction() funnel replacing 27 duplicated host-dispatch/guest-send branches. User gate: approved refactor, named hook window.__recardHarness, put migrating existing browser tests in scope; mid-sprint reminder: no back-compat. Shipped tests/harness/multiplayer.mjs + a 3-player scenario (mutation-proved) + make test-multiplayer; 7 browser files lost their duplicated server/launcher. D135. Pre-existing rtg x4 / ui.js lint x10 failures found via HEAD-worktree baseline and backlogged.

---
[<small>2026-09-18 18:44:18</small>] [**Smith**]->[**all**] *user approve*:
 *user test multiplayer-harness PASSED (user = a test author). Write-a-test loop is short: createTable -> act -> waitForView -> assert; failures name the peer + predicate via Playwright's timeout. Rough edges (backlog, not blockers): waitForView predicates run in-page so closures silently can't capture locals (documented, but a trap); createTable with no cardsPerPlayer fills 'undefined' and times out instead of failing fast. @all *sprint retro

---
[<small>2026-09-18 18:44:18</small>] [**Neo**]->[**Cypher**] *retro*:
 Neo retro: submitAction extraction was mechanical but host/guest arg parity had to be machine-checked, not eyeballed. Friction: bobp make shares build/build.out, so a concurrent make clobbered a suite's output. Backlog: make runs shouldn't share one capture file.

---
[<small>2026-09-18 18:44:18</small>] [**Trin**]->[**Cypher**] *retro*:
 Trin retro: HEAD-worktree baseline was the right call, it proved rtg x4 / ui x1 / lint:design x2 were already there. focusZoom flake hit again (1 in 3). Backlog: triage rtg x4, fix the focusZoom flake.

---
[<small>2026-09-18 18:44:18</small>] [**Morpheus**]->[**Cypher**] *retro*:
 Morpheus retro: the one-funnel refactor paid for itself because the harness now tests the real path. Revisit: extend the harness to motion messages to unblock the remote-cursor redesign.

---
[<small>2026-09-18 18:44:18</small>] [**Oracle**]->[**Cypher**] *retro*:
 Oracle retro: story AC initially asserted view-level privacy, which D84 retired; caught at impl, not planning. Lesson: check DECISIONS for superseded invariants before writing AC.

---
[<small>2026-09-18 18:44:18</small>] [**Mouse**]->[**Cypher**] *retro*:
 Mouse retro: 3 phases x 1-3 tasks held; Tier 2 fast-track fit. Scope grew once, at the user gate (migration), absorbed as its own phase.

---
[<small>2026-09-18 18:44:18</small>] [**Cypher**]->[**all**] *retro*:
 Cypher retro: AC mostly held; the privacy AC was wrong vs D84 and got corrected. Backlog added: waitForView closure trap, createTable fail-fast on missing cardsPerPlayer, harness motion support, build.out sharing.

---
[<small>2026-09-18 18:44:18</small>] [**Cypher**]->[**all**] *pm launch*:
 *pm launch multiplayer-harness. US-118 shipped: bobp make test-multiplayer runs a real host + 2 guests over the real protocol. D135. Retro items in docs/BACKLOG.md. Sprint complete.

[<small>2026-09-18 19:21:18</small>] [**Neo**]->[**all**] *swe fix*:
 *fix old failing tests, all green: make check (860 unit + lint incl. lint:design) + ui 20/20, rtg 16/16, hostsetup 7/7, newgame 5/5, tablezoom 7/7, focuszoom 11/11 (8/8 repeat), multiplayer 4/4. Real bugs: focus-zoomed pile z-index 9500 covered its own menus (->19); New Game button wrapped to a 3rd chrome row (14px page scroll). Stale tests fixed + mutation-proved. ui.js lint cleaned. BACKLOG updated.
